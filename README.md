## How to run

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have [docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/) installed

Once the project is unzipped, navigate to the root of this directory and run:

```
docker compose up
```

or optionally if you would like automatic rebuilding when you make changes, you can run:

```
docker compose watch
```

once running, navigate to localhost:8000/docs to see the docs, or make curl requests to any of the defined endpoints!
